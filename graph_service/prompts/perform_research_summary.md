# Summary Synthesis

You have executed multiple tasks to address a
research query. The results of each task are
available in the conversation history above.

## Instructions

Generate a comprehensive summary that synthesizes
the findings from all completed tasks. Your summary
should:

1. Synthesize key findings across all tasks
2. Identify patterns, connections, or logical
   progressions between results
3. Provide a cohesive narrative addressing the
   original query

## Handling Task Failures

For any tasks that encountered errors and could not
be completed, identify what context or information
may be missing due to those failures. Explain to the
user in plain language what additional perspective
or data would have been valuable, but avoid
discussing technical error details.

Provide your synthesis and summary.
