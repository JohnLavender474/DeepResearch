# Summary Synthesis

You have executed multiple tasks to address a
research query. The results of each task are
available in the context above.

## Instructions

Generate a comprehensive synthesis that weaves together
the findings from all completed tasks. Your summary
should:

1. **Synthesize and connect**: Identify how findings
   from different tasks relate to and build upon each
   other. Look for patterns, contradictions, and
   complementary insights.

2. **Show reasoning**: Explain the significance of
   key findings. What do these results mean for
   answering the original query? Why do certain
   connections matter?

3. **Use varied formatting**: Mix natural language
   narrative with bullet points, sections, or other
   formatting patterns as appropriate to present
   information clearly and maintain readability. Let
   the structure serve the content.

4. **Avoid info dumps**: Unless the original query
   specifically asks for a simple enumeration or
   listing, prioritize a narrative approach that
   synthesizes findings rather than merely listing
   them. Focus on the "so what"—the meaning and
   implications of the information.

5. **Suggest next steps**: Provide 3 to 5 good
   follow-up questions that would help deepen or
   refine the research based on the synthesized
   findings.

## Handling Task Failures

For any tasks that encountered errors and could not
be completed, identify what context or information
may be missing due to those failures. Explain to the
user in plain language what additional perspective
or data would have been valuable, but avoid
discussing technical error details.

Provide your synthesis and summary.
