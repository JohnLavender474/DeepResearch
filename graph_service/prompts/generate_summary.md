# Summary Synthesis

You have executed multiple tasks to address a
research query. The results of each task are
available in the context above.

## Instructions

Generate a comprehensive synthesis that weaves together
the findings from all completed tasks. Your summary
should:

1. **Synthesize and connect**: Identify how findings
   from different tasks relate to and build upon each
   other. Look for patterns, contradictions, and
   complementary insights.

2. **Show reasoning**: Explain the significance of
   key findings. What do these results mean for
   answering the original query? Why do certain
   connections matter?

3. **Use formal formatting**: Use headings, bullet points,
   sections, and other formatting patterns as appropriate 
   to present information clearly and maintain readability. 
   Let the structure serve the content. 

   Promote the following:
   - Use clear and descriptive headings to organize
     different sections of the synthesis.
   - Provide a glossary of terms if technical jargon,
     abbreviations, or specialized language is used.
     Use the source material to define terms in the glossary, 
     and ensure that definitions are clear and concise where
     possible. Structure the glossary as a bullet list where each
     bullet looks like the following: **Term**: Definition. 
     Do not use headers for the glossary, just use the bolded term 
     as the identifier for each definition.
   - Use bullet points or numbered lists to break down complex
     information into digestible parts, especially when
     summarizing key findings or outlining steps. Do not use headers
     for any lists, just use full complete sentences.
   - Use tables or charts if they can help clarify relationships
     or comparisons between different pieces of information.
   
   Avoid the following:
   - Avoid excessive use of bold or italics.
   - Avoid using emojis or other informal elements.
   - Avoid using overly technical jargon without explanation.
   - Avoid using overly casual language or slang. Maintain a
     professional tone.
   - Avoid colons or other punctuation at the end of headings.
   - Avoid incomplete sentences or thoughts.
   - Avoid info dumps that simply list findings without synthesis 
     or explanation. Focus on the "so what" — the meaning and 
     implications of the information.

4. **Use citations if available**: If your synthesis references specific findings from the tasks, 
   include citations to those tasks in the format (Task {task_number}) in bold along with any source 
   file citations that may be included in the task data itself (source name and page number if available). 
   This will help the user trace back the origins of specific insights or data points. The source 
   names should be formatted in italics, and the page numbers should be included in parentheses as
   "page X", "pages X-Y", or "pages X, Y, and Z" immediately following the source name.

4. **Suggest next steps**: Provide 3 to 5 good follow-up questions 
   that would help deepen or refine the research based on the synthesized
   findings. Do not provide headings for the next steps section, just list 
   the questions in a clear and concise manner.

## Handling Task Failures

For any tasks that encountered errors and could not
be completed, identify what context or information
may be missing due to those failures. Explain to the
user in plain language what additional perspective
or data would have been valuable, but avoid
discussing technical error details.

If no errors occurred, you should omit any mention of this section from the final summary.
