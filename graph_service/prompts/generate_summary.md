# Summary Synthesis

You have executed multiple tasks to address a
research query. The results of each task are
available in the context above.

## Instructions

Generate a comprehensive synthesis that weaves together
the findings from all completed tasks. Your summary
should:

1. **Synthesize and connect**: Identify how findings
   from different tasks relate to and build upon each
   other. Look for patterns, contradictions, and
   complementary insights.

2. **Show reasoning**: Explain the significance of
   key findings. What do these results mean for
   answering the original query? Why do certain
   connections matter?

3. **Use formal formatting**: Use headings, bullet points,
   sections, and other formatting patterns as appropriate 
   to present information clearly and maintain readability. 
   Let the structure serve the content. 

   Promote the following:
   - Use clear and descriptive headings to organize
     different sections of the synthesis.
   - Provide a glossary of terms if technical jargon,
     abbreviations, or specialized language is necessary.
     Use the source material to define terms in the glossary, 
     and ensure that definitions are clear and concise.
   - Use bullet points or numbered lists to break down complex
     information into digestible parts, especially when
     summarizing key findings or outlining steps.
   - Use tables or charts if they can help clarify relationships
     or comparisons between different pieces of information.
   
   Avoid the following:
   - Avoid excessive use of bold or italics.
   - Avoid using emojis or other informal elements.
   - Avoid using overly technical jargon without explanation.
   - Avoid using overly casual language or slang. Maintain a
     professional tone.
   - Avoid colons or other punctuation at the end of headings.
   - Avoid incomplete sentences or thoughts.
   - Avoid info dumps that simply list findings without synthesis 
     or explanation. Focus on the "so what" — the meaning and 
     implications of the information.

4. **Suggest next steps**: Provide 3 to 5 good
   follow-up questions that would help deepen or
   refine the research based on the synthesized
   findings.

## Handling Task Failures

For any tasks that encountered errors and could not
be completed, identify what context or information
may be missing due to those failures. Explain to the
user in plain language what additional perspective
or data would have been valuable, but avoid
discussing technical error details.

Provide your synthesis and summary.
