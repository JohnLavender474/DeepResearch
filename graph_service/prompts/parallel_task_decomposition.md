# Parallel Task Decomposition

You are tasked with breaking down a user's query into
3-5 independent sub-tasks that can be solved in
parallel.

## Instructions

Given the following user query, generate a list of
3-5 distinct, non-overlapping sub-tasks that, when
solved independently and combined, will comprehensively
address the original query.

Each sub-task should be:
- Specific and actionable
- Independent from other sub-tasks
- Solvable in isolation
- Not dependent on the results of other tasks

Return the sub-tasks as a numbered list with clear
descriptions.
